    <h1>French Fries Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>    
        <li>4 large potatoes</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: pepper, paprika, garlic powder, or your favorite seasoning</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Wash and peel the potatoes. Cut them into thin strips, about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Rinse the cut potatoes in cold water to remove excess starch. Pat them dry with a clean towel.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>Carefully add the potato strips to the hot oil in batches, avoiding overcrowding. Fry for about 3-4 minutes until they are golden and crispy.</li>
        <li>Use a slotted spoon to remove the fries from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
        <li>Immediately season with salt and any additional seasonings you like while they are still hot.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy your delicious homemade French fries!</li>
